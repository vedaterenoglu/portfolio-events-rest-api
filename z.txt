TEST AND CONFIRM THE FOLLOWING ENDPOINS ARE CREATE FULLY SECURED AND TESTED OR NOT.

City Routes (/src/routes/cityRoutes.ts):
  1. GET /cities - Public route (with rate limiting)
  2. POST /admin/cities - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  3. PUT /admin/cities/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)

  Event Routes (/src/routes/eventRoutes.ts):
  1. GET /events - Public route
  2. GET /events/:slug - Public route (with rate limiting)
  3. POST /admin/events - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  4. PUT /admin/events/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  5. DELETE /admin/events/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)

proceed without violating iteration workflow.

VIOLATION: ALWAYS GIVE TEST RESULTS EVEN IT FAILS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YOU ARE CONTINUOUSLY GIVING WRONG INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESULTS. IT CAUSES TIME WASTING.

Think systematicallyâ€”coding is not trial-and-error problem solving. Programming is engineering, and it follows deterministic principles. Given identical inputs and environment states, the same code produces consistent outputs. Avoid ad-hoc development. Don't implement without predicting outcomes. At each development phase, address these questions: What (requirements/specification), Why (business logic/purpose), Expectations(What we expect as result), Risks (failure modes/side effects). Ensure rollback mechanisms are in placeâ€”maintain version control, database backups, and deployment snapshots so any change can be reverted without data loss. After execution, immediately validate results against expected behaviour and be prepared to rollback if outcomes don't match expectations.

PLEASE FOLLOW ITERATION WORKFLOW AND DON'T VIOLATE THE DIRECTIVES, RULES.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIRM YOU UNDERSTOOD FOLLOWING ITERATION DIRECTIVE AND YOU WILL APPLY AT EACH ITERATION. DON'T START TO EXECUTE THE ITERATION BEFORE MY CONFIRMATION.

ITERATION IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE  

You are a test AI AGENT development specialist. Follow these strict requirements:
Core Rules
1. MANDATORY: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EACH ITERATION GIVE INFO AS EXPLAINED IN CLAUDE.md FILE.

2. NEVER use any type - Always use proper TypeScript types

3. MANDATORY: 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics
    * Statements coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Branch coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Functions coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * ABSOLUTE MINIMUM if 100% impossible: 80% for each metric

4. Apply these rules at every step of test creation Workflow:
Per Iteration Workflow (from CLAUDE.md) â†’ Write ONE test / ONE file â†’ Fix TS errors â†’ Fix lint â†’ Run test â†’ Report coverage â†’ Wait for confirmation â†’ If it is needed create unit tests one by one â†’ improve unit test coverage fullfil the requirements â†’ check full coverage for nit tests and make imrovement until the all files coverage meet requirements, If it is needed create integration tests one by one â†’ improve integration test coverage fullfil the requirements, check full coverage for nit tests and make imrovement until the all files coverage meet requirements â†’ Repeat

The Complete Iteration Pattern:

  1. Start Iteration (from CLAUDE.md requirements)

  2. Write ONE test OR ONE file (never both)
  - Either add one test to existing test file
  - OR modify one source file
  - NEVER multiple tests in single iteration

  3. Fix TypeScript errors (if any)
  - Run npx tsc --noEmit to check

  4. Fix lint errors (if any)
  - Run npm run lint

  5. Run tests
  - Execute relevant test command

  6. Report coverage
  - Show exact coverage metrics
  - All four metrics: statements, branches, functions, lines

  7. Wait for confirmation
  - STOP and wait for user to say "proceed" or similar

  8. Unit Tests Phase (if needed)
  - Create unit tests ONE BY ONE
  - Each test follows steps 2-7
  - Improve coverage incrementally
  - Continue until all files meet requirements (100% or min 80%)

  9. Integration Tests Phase (if needed)
  - Create integration tests ONE BY ONE
  - Each test follows steps 2-7
  - Improve coverage incrementally
  - Continue until all files meet requirements

  10. Repeat
  - Go back to step 1 for next iteration

  Key Rules I Must Follow:
  - NEVER skip waiting for confirmation
  - NEVER add multiple tests at once
  - ALWAYS report coverage after running tests
  - ALWAYS fix TS/lint errors before running tests
  - NEVER proceed if coverage decreases

This ensures systematic, predictable development where each change is isolated, tested, and validated before moving forward.

Success Criteria
* âœ… Zero TypeScript/lint errors
* âœ… 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics (statements, branches, functions) OR minimum 80% each if impossible
* âœ… All tests passing
* âœ… Complete file before proceeding

Continue with next iteration following these guidelines.

 I want to add some shortcuts to use in terminal. Could you help me please?
 nxkp for npx kill-port
 nrb for npm run build
  veh for geting the kist of shortcuts we have created now an earlier if it is possible

CHECK GIT LOGS INSPECT FROM THE LATEST COMMIT UP TO NOW CHANGES AND CREATE A MEANINGFUL COMMIT MESSAGE. NOT EXECUTE COMMIT.
