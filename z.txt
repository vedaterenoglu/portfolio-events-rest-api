City Routes (/src/routes/cityRoutes.ts):

  1. GET /cities - Public route (with rate limiting)
  2. POST /admin/cities - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  3. PUT /admin/cities/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)

  Event Routes (/src/routes/eventRoutes.ts):

  1. GET /events - Public route
  2. GET /events/:slug - Public route (with rate limiting)
  3. POST /admin/events - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  4. PUT /admin/events/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  5. DELETE /admin/events/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)

Think systematically‚Äîcoding is not trial-and-error problem solving. Programming is engineering, and it follows deterministic principles. Given identical inputs and environment states, the same code produces consistent outputs. Avoid ad-hoc development. Don't implement without predicting outcomes. At each development phase, address these questions: What (requirements/specification), Why (business logic/purpose), Expectations(What we expect as result), Risks (failure modes/side effects). Ensure rollback mechanisms are in place‚Äîmaintain version control, database backups, and deployment snapshots so any change can be reverted without data loss. After execution, immediately validate results against expected behaviour and be prepared to rollback if outcomes don't match expectations.

PLEASE FOLLOW ITERATION WORKFLOW AND DON'T VIOLATE THE DIRECTIVES, RULES.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIRM YOU UNDERSTOOD FOLLOWING ITERATION DIRECTIVE AND YOU WILL APPLY AT EACH ITERATION. DON'T START TO EXECUTE THE ITERATION BEFORE MY CONFIRMATION.

## ITERATION IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE  

You are a test AI AGENT development specialist. Follow these strict requirements:
Core Rules
1. MANDATORY: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EACH ITERATION GIVE INFO AS EXPLAINED IN CLAUDE.md FILE.
2. NEVER use any type - Always use proper TypeScript types
3. AT EACH ITERATION ADD OR EDIT ONLY ONE FILE OR ONE TEST NOT MORE.
4. MANDATORY: 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics
    * Statements coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Branch coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Functions coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * ABSOLUTE MINIMUM if 100% impossible: 80% for each metric
5. Always report coverage results after running tests
6. Complete current file fully before asking about next file
7. Check errors AFTER code changes: TypeScript ‚Üí Lint ‚Üí Run tests
8. Apply these rules at every step of test creation
Workflow

Per Iteration Workflow (from CLAUDE.md) ‚Üí Write ONE test / ONE file  ‚Üí Fix TS errors ‚Üí Fix lint ‚Üí Run test ‚Üí Report coverage ‚Üí Wait for confirmation ‚Üí Repeat
Success Criteria
* ‚úÖ Zero TypeScript/lint errors
* ‚úÖ 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics (statements, branches, functions) OR minimum 80% each if impossible
* ‚úÖ All tests passing
* ‚úÖ Complete file before proceeding

Continue with next iteration following these guidelines.

---------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK GIT LOGS INSPECT FROM THE LATEST COMMIT UP TO NOW CHANGES AND CREATE A MEANINGFUL COMMIT MESSAGE. NOT EXECUTE COMMIT.
