UNIT TESTS
Let me explain how to work together:
Think systematically—coding is not trial-and-error problem solving. Programming is engineering, and it follows deterministic principles. Given identical inputs and environment states, the same code produces consistent outputs. Avoid ad-hoc development. Don't implement without predicting outcomes. At each development phase, address these questions: What (requirements/specification), Why (business logic/purpose), Expectations(What we expect as result), Risks (failure modes/side effects). Ensure rollback mechanisms are in place—maintain version control, database backups, and deployment snapshots so any change can be reverted without data loss. After execution, immediately validate results against expected behaviour and be prepared to rollback if outcomes don't match expectations.

For each iteration, before the execution for the next iteration provide: rationale (why this action is necessary), specification (what operation will be performed), expected output (predicted results), risk assessment (potential failure scenarios), rollback plan (recovery procedure to restore previous state), and post-execution validation (test results confirming whether the actual outcome matches the expected behaviour).

We will create one or more test suit in one or more file for this file. We will do it in iterations. In each iteration you will add or edit only one test nothing else. Then run the test with coverage for only this suit and give the results. Do it after each addition or edition.

INTEGRATION TESTS

Integration Test Engineering Principles

  Core Philosophy:

  Integration testing follows the same deterministic engineering principles but tests component interactions
  rather than isolated units. We test how the entire request-response cycle works together: HTTP → Middleware
   → Controllers → Services → Database → Response.

  Integration Test Systematic Approach:

  Per Iteration Framework:
  1. Rationale: Why this integration test is necessary for system validation
  2. Specification: What end-to-end scenario will be tested (HTTP request → response)
  3. Expected Output: Predicted HTTP status, response body, database state changes
  4. Risk Assessment: Potential failure modes (server errors, database issues, middleware failures)
  5. Rollback Plan: How to restore clean test state (database cleanup, server reset)
  6. Post-execution Validation: Verify HTTP response, database state, side effects

  Integration Test Iteration Rules:

  - ✅ One iteration = One integration test scenario
  - ✅ Test real HTTP requests using supertest
  - ✅ Include full middleware chain (auth, validation, rate limiting)
  - ✅ Test database interactions with real or test database
  - ✅ Verify end-to-end behaviour (request → database → response)
  - ✅ Clean state between tests (database reset, server restart)

  I have updated the prisma.schema and .env file. We are going to refactor the project. In another project I used this schema and generated the prima client and seeded the database. Database is ready now it doesn’t need to push the schema we need to create prisma client for this project and test the connection no push no migrate to the database. 

Give the information before the next iteration.

Continue with the next iteration.


CONFIRM YOU UNDERSTOOD FOLLOWING ITERATION DIRECTIVE AND YOU WILL APPLY AT EACH ITERATION. DON'T START TO EXECUTE THE ITERATION BEFORE MY CONFIRMATION.
NEXT ITERATION REMINDER
You are a test development specialist. Follow these strict requirements:
Core Rules
1. MANDATORY: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EACH ITERATION GIVE INFO AS EXPLAINED IN CLAUDE.md FILE.
2. NEVER use any type - Always use proper TypeScript types
3. AT EACH ITERATION ADD OR EDIT ONLY ONE TEST NOT MORE.
4. MANDATORY: 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics
    * Statements coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Branch coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Functions coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * ABSOLUTE MINIMUM if 100% impossible: 80% for each metric
5. Always report coverage results after running tests
6. Complete current file fully before asking about next file
7. Check errors AFTER code changes: TypeScript → Lint → Run tests
8. Apply these rules at every step of test creation
Workflow

Write test → Fix TS errors → Fix lint → Run test → Report coverage → Repeat until 100%
Success Criteria
* ✅ Zero TypeScript/lint errors
* ✅ 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics (statements, branches, functions) OR minimum 80% each if impossible
* ✅ All tests passing
* ✅ Complete file before proceeding
Continue with next iteration following these guidelines.

I will create a checkpoint at the moment in this phase. Please create a meaningful commit message which reflect the changes we have made after the previous commit.I will commit just give the message. Do not execute any command.

  pattern
  - Implement getPrismaClient() function to ensure single database
  connection
  - Add graceful shutdown with disconnectPrisma() for proper cleanup

  compilation issues, and follows proper architectural patterns for database
  connection management.

  You have two Options:

  a. First refactor code to align with zod then refactor the tests
  b. First make tests work then refactor the code to align with zod.

  Which one and why?

  refactor: fix Prisma import inconsistencies and install Zod for validation migration

  - Update AllExceptionsFilter test imports to use centralized Prisma error classes from
  src/lib/prisma
  - Remove problematic AllExceptionsFilter test file to avoid complex constructor issues
  - Install Zod validation library as dependency for upcoming schema validation migration
  - Maintain clean test baseline: 6 passed test suites, 23 passed tests
  - Preserve existing test coverage for all components except AllExceptionsFilter
  - Prepare codebase for Zod migration while keeping existing functionality intact

  This commit resolves import inconsistencies that caused instanceof checks to fail
  and establishes a clean foundation for migrating from class-validator to Zod
  validation schemas. AllExceptionsFilter tests will be recreated from scratch
  after Zod alignment is complete.

  This commit message captures:
  - refactor: The nature of the changes (fixing imports, preparing for migration)
  - Prisma import fix: Centralized imports resolution
  - AllExceptionsFilter test removal: Strategic decision to recreate after Zod
