CONFIRM THE FOLLOWING ENDPOINS ARE CREATE FULLY SECURED AND TESTED.

  1. GET /cities - Public route (with rate limiting)
  2. POST /admin/cities - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  3. PUT /admin/cities/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)

Think systematically—coding is not trial-and-error problem solving. Programming is engineering, and it follows deterministic principles. Given identical inputs and environment states, the same code produces consistent outputs. Avoid ad-hoc development. Don't implement without predicting outcomes. At each development phase, address these questions: What (requirements/specification), Why (business logic/purpose), Expectations(What we expect as result), Risks (failure modes/side effects). Ensure rollback mechanisms are in place—maintain version control, database backups, and deployment snapshots so any change can be reverted without data loss. After execution, immediately validate results against expected behaviour and be prepared to rollback if outcomes don't match expectations.

PLEASE FOLLOW ITERATION WORKFLOW AND DON'T VIOLATE THE DIRECTIVES, RULES.

CONFIRM YOU UNDERSTOOD FOLLOWING ITERATION DIRECTIVE AND YOU WILL APPLY AT EACH ITERATION. DON'T START TO EXECUTE THE ITERATION BEFORE MY CONFIRMATION.

## ITERATION IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE  

You are a test AI AGENT development specialist. Follow these strict requirements:
Core Rules
1. MANDATORY: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EACH ITERATION GIVE INFO AS EXPLAINED IN CLAUDE.md FILE.
2. NEVER use any type - Always use proper TypeScript types
3. AT EACH ITERATION ADD OR EDIT ONLY ONE FILE OR ONE TEST NOT MORE.
4. MANDATORY: 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics
    * Statements coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Branch coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Functions coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * ABSOLUTE MINIMUM if 100% impossible: 80% for each metric
5. Always report coverage results after running tests
6. Complete current file fully before asking about next file
7. Check errors AFTER code changes: TypeScript → Lint → Run tests
8. Apply these rules at every step of test creation
Workflow

Per Iteration Workflow (from CLAUDE.md) → Write ONE test / ONE file  → Fix TS errors → Fix lint → Run test → Report coverage → Wait for confirmation → Repeat
Success Criteria
* ✅ Zero TypeScript/lint errors
* ✅ 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics (statements, branches, functions) OR minimum 80% each if impossible
* ✅ All tests passing
* ✅ Complete file before proceeding

Continue with next iteration following these guidelines.

  feat: implement PUT /admin/events/:id endpoint with complete security and comprehensive testing

  - Add PUT route handler to AdminEventsController with full security stack
    - JWT authentication and admin role authorization guards
    - Zod schema validation with UpdateEventSchema
    - Integer parameter validation for event ID
    - Proper HTTP status codes and response handling

  - Implement updateEvent method in EventsService with proper error handling
    - Check event existence before update with NotFoundException
    - Type-safe Prisma ORM integration with Prisma.TEventUpdateInput
    - Proper database transaction handling

  - Add comprehensive unit tests for PUT endpoint functionality
    - AdminEventsController tests for updateEvent method
    - EventsService tests for successful update and error scenarios
    - Mock service integration and spy validation

  - Add integration tests for complete PUT endpoint coverage
