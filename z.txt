City Routes (/src/routes/cityRoutes.ts):

  1. GET /cities - Public route (with rate limiting)
  2. POST /admin/cities - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  3. PUT /admin/cities/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)

  Event Routes (/src/routes/eventRoutes.ts):

  1. GET /events - Public route
  2. GET /events/:slug - Public route (with rate limiting)
  3. POST /admin/events - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  4. PUT /admin/events/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)
  5. DELETE /admin/events/:id - Admin route (with auth + admin middleware)

Think systematically—coding is not trial-and-error problem solving. Programming is engineering, and it follows deterministic principles. Given identical inputs and environment states, the same code produces consistent outputs. Avoid ad-hoc development. Don't implement without predicting outcomes. At each development phase, address these questions: What (requirements/specification), Why (business logic/purpose), Expectations(What we expect as result), Risks (failure modes/side effects). Ensure rollback mechanisms are in place—maintain version control, database backups, and deployment snapshots so any change can be reverted without data loss. After execution, immediately validate results against expected behaviour and be prepared to rollback if outcomes don't match expectations.

Give the information before the next iteration.

Continue with the next iteration.

PLEASE FOLLOW ITERATION WORKFLOW AND DON'T VIOLATE THE DIRECTIVES, RULES.


CONFIRM YOU UNDERSTOOD FOLLOWING ITERATION DIRECTIVE AND YOU WILL APPLY AT EACH ITERATION. DON'T START TO EXECUTE THE ITERATION BEFORE MY CONFIRMATION.

## ITERATION IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE  

You are a test AI AGENT development specialist. Follow these strict requirements:
Core Rules
1. MANDATORY: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EACH ITERATION GIVE INFO AS EXPLAINED IN CLAUDE.md FILE.
2. NEVER use any type - Always use proper TypeScript types
3. AT EACH ITERATION ADD OR EDIT ONLY ONE FILE OR ONE TEST NOT MORE.
4. MANDATORY: 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics
    * Statements coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Branch coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * Functions coverage: 100% (REQUIRED)
    * ABSOLUTE MINIMUM if 100% impossible: 80% for each metric
5. Always report coverage results after running tests
6. Complete current file fully before asking about next file
7. Check errors AFTER code changes: TypeScript → Lint → Run tests
8. Apply these rules at every step of test creation
Workflow

Per Iteration Workflow (from CLAUDE.md) → Write ONE test / ONE file  → Fix TS errors → Fix lint → Run test → Report coverage → Wait for confirmation → Repeat
Success Criteria
* ✅ Zero TypeScript/lint errors
* ✅ 100% coverage for ALL THREE metrics (statements, branches, functions) OR minimum 80% each if impossible
* ✅ All tests passing
* ✅ Complete file before proceeding

Continue with next iteration following these guidelines.

I will create a checkpoint at the moment in this phase. Please create a meaningful commit message which reflect the changes we have made after the previous commit.I will commit just give the message. Do not execute any command.

feat: implement comprehensive integration test coverage for sanitization security

  - Add integration test suite for sanitization.ts with 90.9% branch coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
  - Configure DOMPurify and JSDOM mocks in integration-setup.ts to resolve module loading errors
  - Create targeted tests for uncovered branches: null input validation, maxLength truncation, URL protocol validation, slug format validation
  - Fix TypeScript and lint violations (replace 'any' types with proper 'unknown as string' casting)
  - Achieve 98.91% overall integration coverage for statements, 89.74% branches, 98.64% functions
  - Resolve cascading test failures in city.schema and event.schema integration tests
  - Complete all 3 immediate security critical requirements with comprehensive test validation


test: enhance cities query schema unit tests with HTML sanitization and limit validation

  - Add HTML sanitization test for search parameter XSS protection
  - Add limit parameter validation and transformation test
  - Maintain atomic testing approach with one test per iteration
  - Achieve stable 87.5% branch coverage for query parameter validation
  - Total tests increased from 87 to 88 with all passing
